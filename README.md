Description:-

I performed advanced data analysis using SQL. The main objective of this project was to analyze employee-related data and extract useful trends and patterns using SQL queries. The project focused on implementing window functions, subqueries, and CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to solve complex business questions.


I used functions like RANK(), COUNT(), ROW_NUMBER(), LAG(), and TOTAL() to perform advanced analysis. I also implemented nested subqueries using EXISTS, NOT EXISTS, and comparison-based queries to find specific conditions. CTEs were used to break complex queries into readable parts and to reuse logic.

All SQL queries are written clearly with inline comments for better understanding. The outputs and screenshots of the queries are combined in a Word file with analysis.

This project helped me improve my SQL skills and understand how to solve real-world problems using data. It also taught me how to write clean, readable, and optimized queries.# -DATA-ANALYSIS-WITH-COMPLEX-QUERIES
